# Expense Management App

I built this application to practice designing a complete personal finance system that goes beyond simple CRUD by adding visualization, reporting, and bulk data handling. It allows users to track incomes and expenses, visualize financial data through charts, upload records from Excel files, and generate PDF reports. The app is implemented using Spring on the backend and Angular on the frontend, with PostgreSQL for storage, Chart.js and Angular Material for the UI, Jasper Studio for report generation, Apache POI for Excel processing, and JWT with Spring Security for authentication.
